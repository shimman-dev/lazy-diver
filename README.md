# Lazy Diver

Dive down a web page at your leisure ðŸŒŠðŸ¤¿ðŸª¸

---

Extension in action:

![lazy-diver demo example](./docs/lazy-diver-demo.gif)

## Why?

For when you're actively doing something on multiple monitors but you're
too lazy to click on a web page and manually scroll down.

## Usage

### `Start Diving?`

`yes` or `no` toggles represent whether the extension is active. When the extension is active it will scroll down an active tab.

### `Scroll Amount (%)`

The amount of `viewport percentage` the extension will scroll down. `Viewport percentage` represents the total height of your browser window
where the active tab is located. This is not a pixel amount. 

### `Interval (seconds)`

The amount of time the extension will wait between scrolls in `seconds`. Default value is `45 seconds`

## Installation

If you'd like additional browser support please open an issue stating as much.

1. Fork or clone the repo and navigate to the code's directory.
2. After navigating to the repo, install the requirements with `npm install`.
3. When installation is complete, run the command `npm run build`.
	- the `build` command also creates a zip file for your usage as well.
4. Open your Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, once here click the `Load Packed` (should be located in the upper left-side of the page).
5. You will be prompted with your operating system's file navigation modal. From here navigate to the `lazy-diver-extension` code repo, then
	 select the directory named `dist/`.
6. Click `Select Folder` (some operating systems may have a `Select` button text instead).
7. Find someone you love and tell them that you successfully installed a browser extension (I'm proud of ya' buddy).
